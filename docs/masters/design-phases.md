1. **Introduction, Vision and Goals**
   - **Purpose**: Provide a brief overview of the document's scope, audience, and key takeaways. Articulate the product's overall vision, mission, objectives. What does the platform unlock?

2. **Principles of System Design**
   - **Purpose**: Outline guiding principles (e.g., scalability, security-first, modularity) that inform all design decisions. Include trade-offs and rationale.
   - **Why this order?**: Follows vision to translate high-level ideas into design constraints. Write it next to establish "rules of the road" that everyone agrees on.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Creates shared design philosophy, making it easier to evaluate later sections against these principles.

3. **Requirements**
   - **Purpose**: Detail functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, reliability, accessibility). Prioritize with MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, etc.).
   - **Why this order?**: Builds on use cases to specify "what" before "how." Write it mid-way to refine based on earlier feedback.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Provides a clear checklist for validation, ensuring architecture meets requirements.

4. **Architecture Overview**
   - **Purpose**: High-level diagram and description of the system's structure (e.g., layers, modules, tech stack overview).
   - **Why this order?**: Directly from your list. Write it after requirements to ensure it addresses them holistically.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Gives a bird's-eye view, aligning teams on the overall blueprint before deep dives.

5. **Systems (Components and Modules)**
   - **Purpose**: Break down individual systems, subsystems, or microservices, including responsibilities, dependencies, and interfaces.
   - **Why this order?**: Expands on the overview. Write it sequentially to detail the "building blocks."
   - **Alignment benefit**: Modularizes complexity, allowing parallel review and alignment on specific parts.

6. **Data Model**
   - **Purpose**: Define entities, relationships, schemas, and data flows (e.g., ER diagrams, APIs for data access). Cover storage, privacy, and compliance.
   - **Why this order?**: Follows systems, as data often underpins components. Write it here to ensure consistency with earlier designs.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Aligns data engineers and developers on core assets, reducing integration issues.

7. **Communication (Interfaces and Protocols)**
   - **Purpose**: Describe how systems interact (e.g., APIs, messaging queues, event-driven patterns). Include error handling and security.
   - **Why this order?**: Builds on data and systems. Write it next to focus on "glue" between components.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Ensures seamless interoperability, aligning backend and frontend teams.

8. **Roadmap**
   - **Purpose**: Define the roadmap for the product. Milestones & Epics.  Phases to be decided as planning step for epics.
   - **Why this order?**: Comes after systems and data model. Write it next to focus on the roadmap.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Ensures the roadmap is aligned with the system design and data model.

9. **Project Structure Bootstrap and Foundation (Epic 0)**
   - **Purpose**: Define the initial project organization, tooling, coding conventions, and development workflow that will support maintainable, AI-friendly modular development. Establish workspace layout, size budgets, contract-first protocols, automated tooling (CI/CD, linting, context generation), and testing strategies. This phase creates the foundation for all subsequent development.
   - **Why this order?**: Comes after architectural decisions to translate system design into concrete project structure. Must be established before implementation begins to ensure consistency and maintainability.
   - **Alignment benefit**: Creates a shared development environment and conventions that enable efficient AI-assisted development, enforce quality gates, and maintain architectural boundaries throughout the project lifecycle.
