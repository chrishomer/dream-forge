# High-Quality 4x Image Upscaling: Open-Source Models and Best Practices

## Open-Source 4x Upscaling Models

* **Stable Diffusion x4 Upscaler** – A text-guided latent diffusion model from Stability AI that upscales images by 4×. It was trained on 10 million high-resolution images (resolutions >2048×2048) with 1.25M training steps, using 512×512 image crops[[1]](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler#:~:text=This%20model%20card%20focuses%20on,to%20a%20predefined%20diffusion%20schedule). This model can **add fine details** during upscaling and even *modify* the image based on a text prompt[[2]](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/stabilityai_stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler/#:~:text=The%20Stable%20Diffusion%20X4%20Upscaler,struggling%20with%20tasks%20that%20involve). It produces impressive results but is computationally heavy and requires substantial VRAM (see below).
* **Real-ESRGAN 4×** – A GAN-based upscaler (an improved ESRGAN) designed for **real-world images**, known to handle faces and natural textures especially well[[3]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=%2A%20ESRGAN%20%E2%80%94%20General,%E2%80%94%20Natural%20textures%2C%20minimal%20artifacts). It is widely regarded as a **reliable** 4× upscaling model for achieving high-resolution results without needing additional training[[4]](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/rtx-3060-performance-evaluation-with-stable-diffusion-web-ui-944391#:~:text=Pros%3A). Real-ESRGAN tends to preserve the original image content while reconstructing details, making it a good choice for photographic or realistic images.
* **ESRGAN (Enhanced SR GAN)** – The original open-source super-resolution GAN, good for **general-purpose** upscaling with excellent sharpening of details[[3]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=%2A%20ESRGAN%20%E2%80%94%20General,%E2%80%94%20Natural%20textures%2C%20minimal%20artifacts). Many variant models exist (for example, specialized ESRGAN models for anime, art, etc.). ESRGAN can produce very sharp results, though older ESRGAN models sometimes introduce **over-sharpened or harsh edges**, which newer models like Real-ESRGAN or SwinIR handle more naturally[[5]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=A6%3A%20Common%20issues%20and%20solutions%3A,or%20lower%20the%20model%20influence).
* **BSRGAN** – A variant of ESRGAN trained for **blurry and noisy inputs**, often recommended for text, graphics, or line art where maintaining **sharp edges** is important[[3]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=%2A%20ESRGAN%20%E2%80%94%20General,%E2%80%94%20Natural%20textures%2C%20minimal%20artifacts). This model is useful if your images contain fine text or UI elements that need clarity after upscaling.
* **SwinIR** – A transformer-based super-resolution model (uses Swin Transformer blocks) that excels at producing \*\*natural textures with minimal artifacts】[[3]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=%2A%20ESRGAN%20%E2%80%94%20General,%E2%80%94%20Natural%20textures%2C%20minimal%20artifacts). SwinIR’s 4× model is known for faithful detail enhancement without the typical GAN “oversharpening” look. It is a strong open-source choice for high-quality upscaling, though a bit slower than ESRGAN-family models (e.g. ~30s vs ~20s for a given image in one test)[[6]](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=The%20boxplot%20shows%20that%20image,with%20just%20under%2030%20seconds).
* **4x-UltraSharp** – A community-developed ESRGAN model noted for extremely **crisp and detailed** results. In comparative tests, 4x-UltraSharp produced some of the best-looking upscaled images and maintained quality across different settings[[7]](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=Image%20quality%20is%20of%20course,any%20of%20the%20latent%20upscalers). This model is not part of default packages but can be downloaded (e.g. from Upscale.wiki) and used similarly to ESRGAN. It’s a non-diffusion upscaler, so it *faithfully* enlarges an image’s details without requiring a text prompt[[8]](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=the%20non,using%20a%20low%20denoising%20strength).

All the above models are open-source and come with pre-trained weights that you can use directly **without additional training**. The best choice may depend on your image content and quality requirements. For example, Stable Diffusion’s upscaler can inject **creative details or stylistic changes** guided by a prompt, whereas ESRGAN-based models tend to preserve the original image’s look more strictly (which can be preferable for fidelity).

## Using the Stable Diffusion x4 Upscaler (Latent Diffusion)

The Stable Diffusion x4 upscaler is essentially a diffusion pipeline specialized for super-resolution. Given a low-resolution input image (and an optional text prompt), it generates a 4× higher-resolution image. Under the hood it encodes the low-res image into latent space, adds a controlled amount of noise, then runs a diffusion model conditioned on the image and text to produce a high-res output[[2]](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/stabilityai_stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler/#:~:text=The%20Stable%20Diffusion%20X4%20Upscaler,struggling%20with%20tasks%20that%20involve). This model was trained on very high-res images, so it learned to introduce fine details during upscaling (e.g. skin texture, fur, texturing of surfaces) beyond simple interpolation.

**Usage in Python:** You can use Hugging Face *Diffusers* for an easy implementation. For example, initialize the pipeline with half-precision:

from diffusers import StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline
pipeline = StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline.from\_pretrained(
 "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler", torch\_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")

This loads the upscaler model in FP16 (to save memory) and moves it to GPU[[9]](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/stabilityai_stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler/#:~:text=model_id%20%3D%20%22stabilityai%2Fstable,cuda). Then prepare your input image and prompt:

low\_res\_img = ... # your PIL image loaded here
prompt = "a detailed photograph" # or any description of the image/style
result = pipeline(prompt=prompt, image=low\_res\_img).images[0]
result.save("upscaled.png")

By default, the pipeline will add only a modest amount of noise to the input (the model’s noise\_level parameter can be adjusted if you want more drastic enhancement). A **neutral prompt** or a prompt describing the image content is often used to guide the upscaler. For instance, if your image is a landscape, providing a prompt like *“detailed landscape photography, high definition”* can help the model reinforce appropriate details. If you want to preserve the image *exactly* and only sharpen it, you should use a very low noise level (the Diffusers pipeline uses a noise schedule internally – keeping it low means changes will be subtle). In practice, many users find the SD upscaler works out-of-the-box without needing to tweak denoising strength; it “just works” to enhance detail when given a reasonable prompt[[10]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=In%20my%20humble%20opinion%20and,official%20implementation%20by%20Stability%20AI).

**VRAM and Performance:** The Stable Diffusion upscaler is a heavy model – it includes a large UNet and CLIP text encoder. Upscaling a 1024×1024 image to 4096×4096 is essentially running Stable Diffusion on a very large latent canvas, which demands a lot of memory. **Expect VRAM usage on the order of 8–12 GB for a 1024→4096 upscale**[[11]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=Input%20%E2%86%92%20Output%20VRAM%20Required,24GB%20VRAM). In fact, the official model card notes that a high-VRAM GPU is needed for this upscaler, and it may be difficult to run on consumer-level cards without optimization[[12]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=The%20Stable%20Diffusion%20x4%20Upscaler,with%20consumer%20GPUs%20to%20use). Empirically, an NVIDIA RTX 3060 12GB can just about handle a ~2 megapixel image (e.g. 1600×1200 input → 6400×4800 output) in one piece when using all optimizations[[13]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=To%20address%20this%20issue%2C%20I%27ve,4%2C%20or%209%20tiles%2C%20respectively). If your GPU has <12GB, you will likely need to optimize and possibly **tile** the image (described below).

To mitigate memory issues, **enable optimizations** before running the pipeline:

* Install and enable **xFormers** for memory-efficient attention. This can significantly reduce VRAM usage during the diffusion process[[14]](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler#:~:text=Notes%3A). In Diffusers, simply installing the xformers package and calling pipeline.enable\_xformers\_memory\_efficient\_attention() will activate it.
* Use **attention slicing** to reduce peak memory. Diffusers allows slicing the attention computation so that only part of it is in memory at a time. Call pipeline.enable\_attention\_slicing() on the pipeline – this lowers memory use at the cost of some speed[[15]](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler#:~:text=,to%20the%20cost%20of%20speed).
* Keep the model in **FP16 precision** (as shown above) so it uses half the memory of full precision. This is usually sufficient for inference and supported on NVIDIA GPU via CUDA.
* **Tiling** (if needed): The SD upscaler pipeline does support taking an image of arbitrary size, but if it doesn’t fit in memory you can manually tile the input image, upscale each tile, and then stitch them back together. The Web UI created by Subarasheese for this upscaler uses an N×N grid tiling approach (e.g. 2×2 = 4 tiles) to upscale large images on smaller GPUs[[12]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=The%20Stable%20Diffusion%20x4%20Upscaler,with%20consumer%20GPUs%20to%20use). Tiling avoids the OOM (out-of-memory) error, **but** be aware of potential seam artifacts at the boundaries between tiles[[16]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=,artifacts%20in%20my%20uspcaled%20images). If you implement tiling, you may mitigate seams by overlapping the tiles slightly and blending the edges. (The community is still investigating better ways to avoid tile seams for diffusion upscaling[[17]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=,artifacts%20in%20my%20uspcaled%20images).)
* **Sequential offloading**: If even tiling is problematic, consider running the pipeline with partial CPU offloading. For example, Diffusers with Accelerate can offload some model weights to CPU and bring them in layer by layer. This allows running the model with less VRAM, at the cost of speed. In practice, for a 1024→4096 upscale, it’s recommended to have at *least* ~8 GB free on the GPU[[11]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=Input%20%E2%86%92%20Output%20VRAM%20Required,24GB%20VRAM). Freeing up other processes or using a machine with more memory is preferable to heavy offloading, which will be very slow.

## Using GAN-Based Upscalers (Real-ESRGAN and ESRGAN Variants)

**Real-ESRGAN** provides a more lightweight alternative for 4× upscaling. It is based on an enhanced super-resolution GAN architecture (an improved ESRGAN model) and does a single forward pass to produce the upscaled image (no iterative diffusion). This makes it **much faster** than the diffusion upscaler – typically on the order of a second or two for a 1024→4096 image on a GPU – and it uses less VRAM for the same image size. Real-ESRGAN is trained to be a *“blind”* super-resolver, meaning it can handle mild noise and artifacts in the input and still produce a clean high-res output. It excels at **photographic details**: faces, skin, natural textures like grass or rocks, etc., are handled in a realistic way[[3]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=%2A%20ESRGAN%20%E2%80%94%20General,%E2%80%94%20Natural%20textures%2C%20minimal%20artifacts). In fact, Real-ESRGAN is often recommended when upscaling AI-generated art or photos to avoid the “over-cooked” look older GAN upscalers can give. It’s known to be a **reliable choice for high-quality 4× upscaling**[[4]](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/rtx-3060-performance-evaluation-with-stable-diffusion-web-ui-944391#:~:text=Pros%3A), and many Stable Diffusion workflows use Real-ESRGAN as the final step to increase resolution.

Using Real-ESRGAN in your own Python code is straightforward. The official repository by Xintao provides a Python API (in the BasicSR library), and there’s even a realesrgan package on PyPI. You would load the pre-trained weights (for example, the 4x model weight is often named RealESRGAN\_x4plus.pth) and run your image through it. For instance, using the PyPI package:

from realesrgan import RealESRGAN
from PIL import Image
model = RealESRGAN(device="cuda") # initializes the upscaler
model.load\_weights("RealESRGAN\_x4plus.pth")
img = Image.open("input.png").convert("RGB")
sr\_image = model.predict(img)
sr\_image.save("upscaled.png")

*(The above is a conceptual example; actual usage may differ slightly depending on the package or repo. Ensure you have the correct model weight file and initialization as per the Real-ESRGAN documentation.)*

**Memory considerations:** Real-ESRGAN’s model is roughly 16–32 convolutional layers (depending on variant) and processes the image in tiles internally if needed. Upscaling 1024→4096 with Real-ESRGAN typically fits in ~8GB VRAM or less, and if memory is an issue, the model can also be run on CPU (much slower) or in a tiled mode. Some implementations auto-tile large images to avoid OOM. In summary, it’s quite feasible to run on a consumer GPU. If you encounter memory issues with Real-ESRGAN on a huge image, you can similarly tile the image or use a smaller model (there are “compact” Real-ESRGAN models for lower VRAM, as noted on OpenModelDB[[5]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=A6%3A%20Common%20issues%20and%20solutions%3A,or%20lower%20the%20model%20influence)).

**Output quality:** Real-ESRGAN tends to **preserve the image’s content** – you won’t supply text prompts here, so it won’t invent new objects or radically alter composition. It will mostly sharpen and add plausible texture. One thing to note is that GAN-based upscalers may sometimes produce tiny artifacts (e.g. a slight “GAN noise” or over-sharpening on very fine patterns). If you find the result *too* sharp or unnatural, a trick is to downscale slightly after upscaling or use a different model like SwinIR for a second pass to clean it. However, Real-ESRGAN was explicitly designed to avoid the artifacts ESRGAN had, so it usually gives very natural results. For example, if an older ESRGAN model makes an edge look **harsh or blocky**, switching to Real-ESRGAN or SwinIR yields more **natural-looking details with fewer artifacts**[**[5]**](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=A6%3A%20Common%20issues%20and%20solutions%3A,or%20lower%20the%20model%20influence).

There are also **specialized ESRGAN models** for different content: for instance, *R-ESRGAN 4x+ (Anime6B)* is a variant specifically for anime-style drawings, and **BSRGAN** (mentioned above) is for cases with blur/noise. If your use-case involves illustrations or game textures, you might choose an anime-focused model or even older tools like Waifu2x (which is not GAN but efficient for certain cartoon imagery).

Finally, as mentioned, community models like **4x-UltraSharp** (an ESRGAN-based model) have gained popularity for their exceptional detail. In one comparison, 4x-UltraSharp was subjectively rated to produce some of the *best* upscale quality among many methods tested[[7]](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=Image%20quality%20is%20of%20course,any%20of%20the%20latent%20upscalers). These models can be loaded similarly into ESRGAN/Real-ESRGAN frameworks if you have the weights. They often strike a good balance: since they are “non-latent” upscalers (no diffusion noise involved), you can use them with a very low denoising (or directly as a final upscaler) to **faithfully enlarge an image without content drift**[**[8]**](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=the%20non,using%20a%20low%20denoising%20strength).

## SwinIR and Other Upscaling Methods

**SwinIR** (SWIN Transformer for Image Restoration) deserves a mention as a top-tier method in academic super-resolution. It uses a pure transformer-based architecture (no GAN) to learn upscaling. The 4× SwinIR model produces outputs with **minimal artifacts and very natural texture**[[3]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=%2A%20ESRGAN%20%E2%80%94%20General,%E2%80%94%20Natural%20textures%2C%20minimal%20artifacts). It doesn’t hallucinate extra detail in the way a GAN or diffusion model might; instead it tries to reconstruct the high-res image to minimize error. This means SwinIR’s results often look *clean and realistic*, and it’s less likely to oversharpen edges or introduce strange patterns. In practice, SwinIR is an excellent choice for landscape photos or any scenario where you want a balanced, artifact-free upscale. It has been integrated into some Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g. Automatic1111 web UI offers SwinIR 4x as an upscaler option).

The downside is that SwinIR can be a bit slow and memory-intensive compared to ESRGAN. It’s still faster than a diffusion model (since it’s one forward pass), but the transformer computation on a large 4096×4096 image can take a bit longer than ESRGAN’s CNN – one benchmark showed SwinIR ~30% slower than ESRGAN for a given image[[6]](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=The%20boxplot%20shows%20that%20image,with%20just%20under%2030%20seconds). VRAM-wise, it should be in the same ballpark (SwinIR will also use around 8–12GB for a 1024→4096 upscale, per community figures). If you have the model weights (available from the official SwinIR GitHub or model databases), you can run SwinIR in PyTorch as well – it requires constructing the model architecture and loading the .pth checkpoint. Some third-party forks or UIs provide ready-to-use wrappers for SwinIR similar to Real-ESRGAN’s.

In summary, **SwinIR vs. ESRGAN vs. Stable Diffusion Upscaler**: SwinIR and ESRGAN-family (including Real-ESRGAN) are great for faithful and fast upscaling when you want to preserve the original image’s look. Stable Diffusion’s upscaler is powerful if you need to *add new details or stylize* the image during upscaling (since it can interpret a text prompt and doesn’t strictly preserve everything unless guided to). Often a workflow might involve using Stable Diffusion (with “Hi-Res fix” or a dedicated upscaler model) to generate a larger image with creative detail, and then using an ESRGAN/SwinIR model to finalize or further upscale because they **maintain fidelity at low denoise levels**[**[8]**](https://medium.com/%40realfabianw/comparison-of-stable-diffusions-hires-fix-upscalers-d4cb44a87a8f#:~:text=the%20non,using%20a%20low%20denoising%20strength)[**[5]**](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=A6%3A%20Common%20issues%20and%20solutions%3A,or%20lower%20the%20model%20influence). The best practice is to experiment with a couple models on a test image – you might find, for example, Real-ESRGAN gives a very photo-real result, whereas Stable Diffusion upscaler yields a more *artistic* detail enhancement; the choice depends on your needs.

## Best Practices for Memory Management (Under 12GB VRAM)

Working on Linux with an NVIDIA CUDA GPU (and an AMD CPU, which has no effect on CUDA) is a great setup for these tools. However, with <12GB VRAM, you are near the limit for 4K upscaling tasks. Here are some best practices to **achieve high quality while avoiding out-of-memory errors**:

* **Use Half-Precision:** Load models in FP16 (half) precision whenever possible. This cuts memory usage roughly in half with negligible quality loss in inference. Both Diffusers and ESRGAN models support FP16 weights. The Stable Diffusion Upscale Pipeline example uses torch\_dtype=torch.float16 when loading[[9]](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/stabilityai_stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler/#:~:text=model_id%20%3D%20%22stabilityai%2Fstable,cuda). If a model is not available in FP16, you can often convert its weights or use NVIDIA’s automatic mixed precision during inference.
* **Enable Memory-Efficient Attention:** For diffusion models, installing **xFormers** is highly recommended. It introduces memory-efficient attention mechanisms that significantly reduce VRAM use for the self- and cross-attention layers[[14]](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler#:~:text=Notes%3A). This can be the difference between an image fitting or not. Always verify that xFormers is actually being used (Diffusers will usually log it, or you’ll notice lower memory in tools like nvidia-smi).
* **Attention Slicing / Smaller Batches:** Also for diffusion, use enable\_attention\_slicing()[[15]](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler#:~:text=,to%20the%20cost%20of%20speed). This computes attention in chunks rather than all at once, smoothing out memory peaks. The trade-off is a bit more wall-clock time. Similarly, process images one at a time (batch size 1) – doing multiple images in parallel multiplies memory needs and is not feasible under tight VRAM.
* **Tile Large Images:** If your target output is enormous (e.g. >4096 px) or your GPU is on the smaller side (e.g. 8GB), implement tiling. This applies equally to diffusion or ESRGAN/SwinIR methods. You can split the input into, say, four quadrants (2×2 grid) or more, upscale each tile, then merge them. Each tile then only needs a fraction of the full image’s memory. The Stable Diffusion x4 WebUI allows up to 3×3 grid (9 tiles) for this purpose[[13]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=To%20address%20this%20issue%2C%20I%27ve,4%2C%20or%209%20tiles%2C%20respectively). Start with the smallest number of tiles that works (since tiling too much can degrade quality at the borders). If you see seams, consider overlapping the tiles slightly and averaging the overlap region for a smoother blend.
* **Manage VRAM Usage:** Be mindful of how PyTorch uses GPU memory – sometimes after an image is processed, memory might not be freed immediately (caching). It can help to call torch.cuda.empty\_cache() between large runs, or better, do all upscaling in one script run and then exit to free memory. Also close any other GPU-heavy applications (or browser tabs with GPU acceleration) to free up VRAM[[18]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=Tips%20for%20limited%20VRAM%3A). On Linux, tools like nvidia-smi can show memory per process to help identify any memory hogs.
* **Use CPU or Lower-VRAM Models if Necessary:** If you absolutely cannot fit a model, you have a few options. Diffusers pipelines can offload to CPU (with accelerate’s cpu\_offload or by simply moving the model to CPU – though it will be slow). Some ESRGAN models have **“compact” versions** (smaller networks) that can be used at the cost of a bit of quality[[5]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=A6%3A%20Common%20issues%20and%20solutions%3A,or%20lower%20the%20model%20influence). For instance, Real-ESRGAN has an “animevideo-v3” model that’s faster and lighter for animation upscaling. There are also older algorithms like **Waifu2x** (for 2× upscaling anime images) that are very light on memory and could be applied in multiple passes (this is more of a niche case). Generally, aim to use the optimized models and techniques above before falling back to CPU, since CPU inference for 4K images will be extremely slow.

Finally, as a rule of thumb from community guidance: **1024×1024 → 4096×4096 upscaling will need roughly 8–12 GB VRAM at runtime**[**[11]**](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=Input%20%E2%86%92%20Output%20VRAM%20Required,24GB%20VRAM). If your GPU is in that range, you should be able to manage with the mentioned optimizations. If you only have, say, 6 GB, you will certainly need to tile or offload. If you have 12 GB or more, you can likely run the upscaler directly (especially with xFormers and FP16) – for example, a 12GB card was shown to handle a 4× upscale without tiling when optimizations were on[[13]](https://github.com/Subarasheese/sd-x4-wui#:~:text=To%20address%20this%20issue%2C%20I%27ve,4%2C%20or%209%20tiles%2C%20respectively).

## Conclusion

To achieve **very high-quality 4× upscaling** of a 1024px image with open-source tools, you have a rich toolkit at your disposal. Stable Diffusion’s latent upscaler offers flexibility with text prompts and can produce stunning detail, whereas Real-ESRGAN and SwinIR provide more deterministic and faithful super-resolution with excellent clarity. Many practitioners actually combine approaches (e.g. using Stable Diffusion to add detail and then ESRGAN/SwinIR to finalize). All these models come pre-trained, so you can integrate them directly into your Python workflow – no training required. Focus on the **best practices** above to manage memory: use optimized libraries, half-precision, and tiling or chunking techniques. With an NVIDIA GPU on Linux, these methods have been proven to work well within the 8–12 GB VRAM range for 4K outputs[[11]](https://smartart.live/articles/machine-learning/comfyui-workflows/228-how-to-upscale-images-in-comfyui-esrgan-ai-models-guide.html#:~:text=Input%20%E2%86%92%20Output%20VRAM%20Required,24GB%20VRAM). By choosing the right model for your content (you might even try a quick comparison of SD Upscaler vs. Real-ESRGAN on one image to see which you prefer) and by coding carefully with memory in mind, you’ll be able to produce high-detail, accurate upscales reliably. Enjoy your upscaled images!
